This is SCIN website. The website is different from our app and is a static website. The static website is generated by `npm run export` command.

# Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

# Development

Get your development changes merged into the `develop` branch. To publish the changes to [https://scin.io](https://scin.io), merge your codes to `main` branch.

# Deployments

We are using GitHub Pages to deploy the website. Any code that gets pushed to the `main` branch will be deployed to the `gh-pages` branch. To see the details of deployment, check `deploy_pages.yml` file.
